## Project Brief

Psyduck Panic: Evolution Deluxe is a browser-based retro arcade game where players counter AI hype thought bubbles before their brother transforms into Psyduck from panic overload. Built with React, TypeScript, React Three Fiber (3D), Tone.js (adaptive music), and Miniplex ECS. Deployed as a PWA and native mobile app via Capacitor.

### Core Loop

1. Thought bubbles (enemies) float toward the player
2. Player counters them by type (Reality/History/Logic) via keyboard or click
3. Missed bubbles increase the PANIC meter
4. At 100% panic → game over with grading (S/A/B/C/D)
5. Character visually transforms: Normal (0-33%) → Panic (33-66%) → Psyduck (66-100%)

### Key Goals

- Fun, rewarding escalation from calm to full panic
- Unpredictable boss encounters (missile-command style)
- Real engagement, not fixed patterns
- Ship quality: all checks pass (lint, types, tests, build)

## System Patterns

### Architecture

```
Presentation Layer (Main Thread)
├── React Components (UI/HUD) — Game.tsx, Landing.tsx
├── R3F Canvas (3D Scene) — GameScene.tsx
│   ├── RoomBackground — 3D diorama, monitor glow shifts with panic
│   ├── CharacterModel — Normal/Panic/Psyduck states, dynamic eyes
│   ├── EnemySystem — ECS-driven enemy bubbles with glow
│   ├── BossSystem — Pulsing boss with orbiting orbs
│   ├── ParticleSystem — Burst particles on counter
│   ├── TrailSystem — Ring trails on counter
│   └── ConfettiSystem — Victory confetti
├── Tone.js Music — Adaptive layers that intensify with panic/wave
└── Anime.js — UI animations (HUD, overlays)

Business Logic Layer (Web Worker)
├── GameLogic — Enemy spawning, collision, panic calc, scoring
├── Event Queue — SFX triggers, visual effects, feed updates
└── Boss Management — Boss phases, attacks, HP

ECS Layer (Miniplex)
├── World — Entity definitions (position, velocity, enemy, boss, particle, etc.)
├── Archetypes — enemies, bosses, particles, trails, confettis, powerUps
├── State Sync — Bridges worker GameState → ECS entities each frame
└── React Bindings — miniplex-react createReactAPI

Platform Layer
├── Capacitor — iOS/Android native runtime
├── IndexedDB — Persistent high scores (via idb)
└── PWA — Service worker, offline support
```

### Key Patterns

- **Worker → Main → ECS → R3F**: Game logic in worker, state synced to ECS, R3F systems render ECS entities
- **Ref-based updates**: GameScene uses refs (not state) for 60fps updates without React re-renders
- **Event-driven VFX**: Particles/trails/confetti spawned by event handlers, not synced from worker
- **UI state reducer**: Game.tsx uses `useReducer` with actions defined in `src/lib/ui-state.ts`
- **Grading**: Extracted to `src/lib/grading.ts` — S/A/B/C/D based on accuracy and max combo
- **No monoliths**: Logic lives in `/lib/`, not in `.tsx` files. Components are thin rendering layers.

### Coordinate System

- Game space: 800x600 (GAME_WIDTH x GAME_HEIGHT)
- Scene space: x mapped to (-4, 4), y mapped to (3, -3) via `gx()` / `gy()` helpers
- Each rendering system has its own `gx`/`gy` converters

## Tech Context

### Stack

| Technology | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| React | 19 | UI components |
| TypeScript | 5.9 | Type safety |
| Vite | 7.3 | Build tool, dev server, worker bundling |
| Three.js | 0.182 | 3D rendering |
| @react-three/fiber | 9.5 | React renderer for Three.js |
| @react-three/drei | 10.7 | R3F helpers (Text, Billboard, Line) |
| Miniplex | 2.0 | Entity Component System |
| miniplex-react | 2.0.1 | React bindings for Miniplex (`createReactAPI`) |
| Tone.js | 15.1 | Adaptive music system |
| Anime.js | 4.3 | UI animations |
| Capacitor | 8.1 | Native mobile (iOS/Android) |
| Biome | 2.3 | Linter + formatter |
| Vitest | 4.0 | Unit tests |
| Playwright | 1.58 | E2E tests |

### Critical Package Notes

- **`miniplex-react`** is the correct React bindings package. NOT `@miniplex/react` (incompatible monorepo package).
- `miniplex-react` exports `createReactAPI` as **default export**, provides `<ECS.Entities in={bucket}>` component.
- Miniplex eventery uses `subscribe()` which returns an unsubscribe function (not `add`/`remove`).

### Build Chunks (vite.config.ts)

```
vendor-react, vendor-three, vendor-tone, vendor-anime, game-utils, game-ecs
```

### Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # Dev server
pnpm build        # Production build (runs typecheck + icon gen first)
pnpm typecheck    # TypeScript check

## Active Context

### Current Focus

The R3F + ECS + Tone.js migration is complete and passing all checks. The next major effort is making the panic escalation, Psyduck transformation, and boss encounters into proper "spinal systems" of the game with real algorithms.

### Recent Changes (This Session)

- Migrated rendering from PixiJS to React Three Fiber (3D)
- Added Miniplex ECS for entity management
- Added Tone.js adaptive music system
- Added grading system (S/A/B/C/D) on game over
- Extracted UI state and grading logic into separate modules
- Removed all PixiJS dependencies and dead code
- Fixed all lint, type, and test issues
- Implemented dynamic eye pupil tracking (speed increases with panic)
- Added point light glow to enemy bubbles

### Next Steps

1. **Panic Escalation System**: Replace linear panic with logarithmic/exponential curves that create real tension. The calm→panic→psyduck transformation should feel earned and dramatic.
2. **Yuka.js AI Governors**: Add Yuka.js for real steering behaviors, state machines, and goal-driven AI on bosses and enemy waves. Make bosses unpredictable like missile command.
3. **Boss Overhaul**: Replace fixed patterns with dynamic, AI-driven behaviors. Bosses should feel like real threats with emergent tactics.
4. **E2E Test Overhaul**: DRY out and reorganize Playwright tests.
5. **React Testing Library**: Add component-level tests.

### Active Decisions

- Coordinate space is 800x600 game → (-4,4) / (3,-3) scene. All systems use `gx()`/`gy()` helpers.
- VFX (particles, trails, confetti) are render-only — spawned by events, not synced from worker.
- The `wave` ref is passed into systems that need wave-dependent visuals (boss emoji, room clutter).
- Music layers are controlled by panic level and wave number.

- [ ] Yuka.js AI governors for bosses and enemy behavior
- [ ] AGENTS.md and documentation updates

### Known Issues

- Three.js vendor chunk is ~1.2MB (gzipped ~334KB) — consider code-splitting or lazy loading
- E2E tests need reorganization (DRY refactor)
- No React Testing Library component tests yet
- Boss patterns are currently fixed, not AI-driven

### Architecture Decisions Log

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| R3F over PixiJS | 3D diorama aesthetic, better material/lighting support |
| Miniplex ECS | Clean entity management for particles, enemies, bosses |
| `miniplex-react` (not `@miniplex/react`) | Only compatible React bindings for `miniplex@2.0.0` |
| Tone.js | Real-time adaptive music with synth layers |
| Ref-based scene updates | Avoid React re-renders at 60fps |
| Worker for game logic | Keep main thread free for rendering |
| Logic in `/lib/`, not `.tsx` | No monolith components; thin rendering layers |
