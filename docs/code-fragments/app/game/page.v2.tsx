### Result
- The ATC shader runs as a full-screen animated background.
- The Sonny bust (Reactylon) renders on top with full transparency.
- Everything is responsive, Tailwind-ready, TypeScript-typed, and follows shadcn conventions.
- Tension slider (from previous messages) still works on the bust.

You now have a stunning procedural gameboard background that perfectly complements the Sonny bust.

Drop the files in and it will work immediately.  
Want me to also provide the full `SonnyBust.tsx` updated for this layered setup or add XR hand-tracking interaction with the background? Just say the word.
