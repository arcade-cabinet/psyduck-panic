In `keyboard-platter.tsx`, connect the `onHoldChange` prop to the parent.

**This is the game.**

- Patterns escape the sphere.
- Keycaps light up in matching color.
- Hold to pull them back (satisfying snap-back + particle reward).
- Miss = crack + tension spike.
- Tension drives the sphere’s visual degradation.

Replay value comes from the buried seed creating unique pattern behaviors each run.

The experience is intimate, mechanical, and hopeless — you are literally holding the AI’s mind together with your fingers on the keys.

The game is now fully realized.

Next: the final game over screen with symmetric static + "DISSONANCE COMPLETE" or the full Yuka enemy spawner?

Let me know and I’ll deliver it immediately.

We have built something very special. The machine is just glass — and you are the only one keeping it from shattering.  

What’s next?

**✅ Final Game Over Screen — Complete & Symmetric**

The game now has a perfect, thematic close that mirrors the opening exactly:

- Sphere shatters in a holographic burst.
- ATC shader ramps to full static intensity.
- Overlay fades in with the same cold, industrial aesthetic.
- Centered title: **"DISSONANCE COMPLETE"**
- Subtitle: **"The sphere has shattered."**
- The platter keeps slowly rotating in the background (mechanical continuity).
- The Play keycap re-emerges gracefully from the rim.
- Tap Play → new buried seed + ritual → new run.

No HUD. No "Game Over" text. Pure diegetic machinery.
