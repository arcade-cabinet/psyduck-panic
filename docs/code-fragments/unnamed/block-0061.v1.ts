Take Variant 4 as the base model and improve it to match these exact requirements:

Heavy industrial black metal 3D platter for Babylon.js, viewed from 3/4 angle slightly above, cinematic render style, ultra high detail, dramatic rim shadowing, subtle machined surface wear, cool blue pulsing RGB rim lighting embedded in the outer edge with strong emissive glow, realistic heavy metal PBR material with slight oil sheen.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Platter MUST lie perfectly flat on the ground — no tilt, no floating.
- Platter can ONLY rotate around invisible central vertical axis — completely fixed position, extremely heavy feel.
- Rim must be extremely thick (minimum 18cm visible depth from player side).
- On the side facing the player, a precise horizontal slit emerges from the thick black rim. When activated, a satisfying mechanical garage-door effect occurs: top half slides upward and smoothly recedes into the platter depth, bottom half slides downward and smoothly recedes into the platter depth, revealing visible internal mechanical depth and subtle blue RGB lighting inside the recess. Make this deliberate and mechanical with slight resistance and precise alignment — not instantaneous.
- From this revealed recess, a single customizable keyboard key smoothly emerges with realistic mechanical process — deliberate, satisfying, not instantaneous (gears, slight resistance, precise alignment). The keycap is initially set to a glowing Play symbol (▶), with strong RGB lighting surrounding the key so the recess remains mostly hidden but emits a soft blue-to-cyan glow. Reference the exact mechanical style and button press animation of this key component: https://21st.dev/community/components/theutkarshmail/bluetooth-key/default — adapted to heavy black metal industrial aesthetic with cool blue RGB accents.
- Separately, a lever component emerges from another section of the rim using the exact same garage-door split mechanism. The recess for the lever must remain visibly lit with RGB glow. Reference the exact mechanical style and lever switch animation of this component: https://21st.dev/community/components/theutkarshmail/lever-switch/default — adapted to heavy black metal industrial aesthetic with cool blue RGB accents.
- In the exact center of the platter is a recessed circular track. Sitting inside this track is a large transparent glass sphere (diameter exactly 52cm), rendered as high-quality PBR glass with refraction, thin-film interference, and visible thickness. Inside the glass sphere is the exact celestial nebula shader effect from this reference: https://21st.dev/community/components/dhileepkumargm/celestial-sphere-shader/default. The internal effect starts with calm confident blue tones, transitions through yellows and greens, and finally to violent reds as tension increases, with increasing static, jitter, bounce, and corruption inside the sphere.

COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:
- Do not make the platter vertical or standing up.
- Do not allow any vertical movement, floating, or tilting of the platter.
- Do not make the rim thin.
- Do not make the garage-door animation instantaneous or cartoonish.
- Do not place the glass sphere anywhere except the exact center recessed track.
- Do not add any text, HUD elements, or extra objects.
- Do not make the glass sphere opaque.
- Do not ignore the reference URLs.

Export as clean GLB file optimized for Babylon.js. Use only standard PBR materials compatible with Babylon.js PBRMaterial. Do NOT embed any JavaScript or dynamic code — the model must be 100% CSP-safe.

Generate multiple variants with different rim thicknesses, recess depths, glass sphere transparency levels, and RGB intensity. Prioritize mechanical realism and satisfying animation potential.
