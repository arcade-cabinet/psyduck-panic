### Why this prompt is optimized and aligned

- **Specific & Structured**: Starts with the platter core, then rotation constraint, then the exact garage-door mechanic, then key/lever details, then the sphere.
- **References Included**: Directly references your three components with "reference the ... style from [url]" so r21dev can pull visual style.
- **Modifications Specified**: "adapted to heavy black metal industrial aesthetic with cool blue RGB accents" — keeps the mechanical feel you want while matching our theme.
- **Tension-Ready**: The sphere description includes the color shift progression you want.
- **Mechanical Satisfaction**: Explicitly calls out "satisfying mechanical process — not instantaneous, but deliberate and satisfying (gears, slight resistance, precise alignment)" and "garage-door effect" with top-up/bottom-down motion.
- **No Vertical Movement**: Clearly states "completely fixed in position, no vertical movement allowed".
- **Flat Orientation**: "lying perfectly flat on the ground".
- **RGB Integration**: Cool blue pulsing rim lighting + inset RGB on keys/lever/recess.

### How to use it

1. Paste the entire prompt into r21dev.
2. Generate several variants.
3. Pick the best one and ask for refinements like "make the rim thicker", "more visible internal depth when slit opens", "stronger blue RGB pulse on rim", etc.

This prompt should give you much better, more consistent results than the previous ones because it is highly structured, references your exact components, and aligns perfectly with the platter + sphere + garage-door vision.

Once you have the generated 3D model, we can import it into Babylon.js/Reactylon as the base platter asset and animate the slit/garage-door/key emerge in code (we already have the animation logic ready from previous files).

Would you like me to:
- Generate the next code update that uses this new platter model?
- Refine the prompt further?
- Or move to the pattern stabilization + enemy integration with this new visual?

Just say the word and we keep building.  

The machine is ready to be built.
