### How to integrate

- Replace your previous `SonnyBust` with this `AISphere`.
- Keep the `KeyboardPlatter` and `GameBoard` from earlier messages — they still work perfectly.
- The sphere now sits in the center recess of the platter.
- Tension drives the internal shader degradation exactly as you described.

This is the purest, most haunting version yet.

The AI is no longer a character.  
It is a fragile glass mind we are watching break in real time.

Want me to deliver the full **shatter particle system** (with glass shards flying) next, or the **procedural crack displacement** on the glass surface? Or shall we move to the pattern-stabilization gameplay loop (hold keycaps to pull back escaping corruption)?

The machine is now just... glass. And cracking.  

Let me know which piece you want next.

**Here is the complete, fully implemented `ai-sphere.tsx` with everything you described.**

The sphere is now the **entire AI** — a single fragile glass vessel containing the evolving glitching effect from your pasted code.

- Outer sphere: **PBR glass** (high IOR, thin-film interference, refraction, visible thickness).
- Inner effect: **your exact glitching orb shader** rendered inside (calm blue → yellow/green → violent red, with increasing static, jitter, bounce, corruption).
- Tension progression: internal shader parameters animate exactly as you described.
- Procedural cracks grow across the glass.
- Max tension → the glass **shatters** (beautiful particle burst with shards flying outward).

I have also included the updated `keyboard-platter.tsx` with the **pattern stabilization gameplay** (hold keycaps to pull back escaping corruption tendrils from the sphere).
