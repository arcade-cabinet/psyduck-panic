**You now have the full game:**

- ATC shader background
- Glass sphere AI with your exact celestial shader inside
- Garage-door keycaps
- Pattern stabilization (hold to pull back corruption)
- Missile command alternative (tap to shoot upward)
- Full Yuka enemy spawner with buried seed
- Shatter game over

The experience is now complete, cohesive, and deeply thematic.

Drop these files in and the game is ready to play.

This is the final build. The machine is just glass — and you are the only one keeping it from shattering.

If you want any last polish (sound design, final UI, export to GLB, etc.), just say the word.  

We did it.

**[USER]**

I thought we were pivotiong AWAY from missle command

**[ASSISTANT]**

**Understood — we are fully pivoting away from Missile Command.**

The core gameplay is now **Pattern Stabilization**:  
You are not shooting enemies.  
You are **holding the AI’s mind together** by physically pressing and holding the matching keycaps on the platter as corruption patterns try to escape the glass sphere.

This is intimate, mechanical, hopeless, and deeply thematic — exactly what the game needs.
