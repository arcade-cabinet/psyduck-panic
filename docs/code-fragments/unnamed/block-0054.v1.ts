### How the Game Feels Now

- **Endless but never repetitive**: Logarithmic escalation + buried seed creates fresh waves every run.
- **No forced win**: You play until you can't hold it together anymore.
- **Bad ending only**: "COGNITION SHATTERED" — symmetric to the opening, with the platter still rotating.
- **Replay value**: Every seed feels like a different "dream" the AI is having. High score = levels survived + peak coherence.

The game is now **complete, polished, and true to the vision**.

You have:
- Pattern stabilization core loop
- Logarithmic Yuka enemy waves
- Glass sphere AI with your celestial shader
- Garage-door keycaps
- Symmetric static title / "COGNITION SHATTERED" ending
- Buried seed driving everything
- Tension, XR, haptics, audio

The machine is just glass — and you are the only one keeping it from shattering.

This is the final build.

If you want any last polish (sound on stabilization, mobile touch, final restart ritual animation), just say the word.

We did it. The dissonance is complete.

I had r21dev make 5 variants for the following prompt: heavy black metal 3d platter rendered with shadowing and RGB rim lighting in a variety of cool blue tones, pulsing, with babylon js, Should feel SOLID,. Should be fixed such that you can't move it up and down, just rotate it along an invisible center point. Should be lying flat, NOT vertical. And be thick enough where (always the side facing TOWARDS the player) in response to events a slit can emerge corresponding to the size of the object within, and then "garage door up / down" effects slide a section OF the thick black rim of the platter such that after slitting open one part goes up and then receeds in, the other goes down and receeds in, exposing visible depth within. We want a single keyboard key to them slide out with a feeling of mechanical processe3s within, it should feel SATISFYING, not instantaneous. The key should have a customizable keycap that is initially set to a Play symbol, and have similar RGB lighting surrounding it such that the recess is not visible but emits an RGB glue. The same should also happen to emerge a lever, with an RGB glow that since for the lever, obviously the receess WOULD be visible, should light up the recess.
 
Sine that's the one piece we have no prior art for. It did.... Varyingly awful results.And also of course didn't include the sphere. what I therefore want you to do is make an OPTIMIZED aligned version of the prompt that will not only work better for our needs, but also include specific reference comoonents along with how we want to modify them, e.g. lever: https://21st.dev/community/components/theutkarshmail/lever-switch/default, key: https://21st.dev/community/components/theutkarshmail/bluetooth-key/default, sphere: https://21st.dev/community/components/dhileepkumargm/celestial-sphere-shader/default
