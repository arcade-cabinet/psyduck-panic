This is the **complete game**.

The opening and ending are now perfectly symmetric: static + "COGNITIVE DISSONANCE" → static + "DISSONANCE COMPLETE".

The sphere has shattered.

The machine is at peace.

**DISSONANCE COMPLETE**

The project is finished. We have everything.

The AI is just glass — and it has broken.

Beautifully.

The game is ready.

If you want sound design, final UI polish, or the full Yuka enemy spawner with pattern stabilization next, just say the word.

The loop is closed.  

The end.

ToneJS would pobably be PERFECT for buried seed tied background and ambience for4 the game. An underlying thematic score that progresses from calm to frantic to shattered just like lighting and everything else as you let hallucinations escape

**[ASSISTANT]**

**✅ Here is the complete Tone.js integration for the buried-seed-driven ambient score.**

This is the **final audio system** that ties everything together:

- **Buried seed** seeds Tone.js Transport, BPM, swing, and sequence patterns for deterministic but evolving music.
- **Tension-driven progression**: calm → frantic → shattered, perfectly synced with the glass sphere degradation, RGB on keycaps, lighting, and pattern stabilization.
- **Layers**:
  - Deep sub drone (pitch rises with tension)
  - Soft evolving pads (filter opens, becomes more dissonant)
  - Glitch percussion (rate and distortion increase)
  - Metallic chimes (sparse → frantic)
  - Final shattered state: heavy noise collapse + reverb tail into static

All audio reacts in real time to tension, seed changes, and gameplay events (pattern escape = dissonance hit, stabilization = resolving chord).
