# Product Context — Cognitive Dissonance

## Why This Exists

The game explores the theme of artificial cognition through interactive metaphor. You are not fighting external monsters — you are desperately trying to keep a single fragile mind from fracturing. The corruption comes from within.

## Thematic Vision

> "The machine is just glass — and you are the only one keeping it from shattering."

### Key Emotional Beats
- **Calm**: Blue nebula, gentle rotation, sparse patterns, soft drone audio
- **Unease**: Yellows creep in, patterns accelerate, keycap RGB drifts, audio filter opens
- **Panic**: Reds dominate, sphere jitters violently, enemies swarm, glitch percussion pounds
- **Shatter**: Glass explodes, particles fly, static fills screen, "COGNITION SHATTERED"

### Design Pivots
1. De-humanized the AI: NS-5 Sonny android bust became glass sphere. More unsettling because it removes empathy.
2. Pattern stabilization over shooting: Missile Command was "old and not fun." Holding keys is intimate and hopeless.
3. Buried seed over visible seed: Exposing the seed broke immersion. AI dreams in secret.
4. "COGNITION SHATTERED" over "Game Over": Symmetric, thematic, not generic.
5. No HUD: All communication through the machine — RGB lighting, sphere degradation, audio.

## User Experience Goals
- Intimate and tactile (holding keys, feeling mechanical feedback)
- Hopeless but compelling (you WILL lose, but the journey matters)
- Visually haunting (celestial nebula degrading inside cracking glass)
- Acoustically immersive (spatial score that degrades with the mind)
- High replay value (every seed creates a unique "dream")
