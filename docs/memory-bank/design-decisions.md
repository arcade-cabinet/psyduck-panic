# Design Decisions — Cognitive Dissonance

## Why Glass Sphere Instead of Sonny Bust

Original: NS-5 android (Sonny from I, Robot) sitting at desk.
Evolution: Full bust -> rear bust -> HAL eye -> pure glass sphere.
The sphere is MORE powerful because it removes empathy, makes corruption internal, and glass = fragility.

## Why Pattern Stabilization Instead of Missile Command

Missile Command felt old, violent, external. Pattern stabilization is intimate, mechanical, hopeless, non-violent, and diegetic. You're touching the mind directly through the interface.

## Why Buried Seed

Visible seed (Adjective-Adjective-Noun) broke the fourth wall. Buried seed means the AI dreams in secret. New Game button IS the shuffle.

## Why "COGNITION SHATTERED" Not "Game Over"

Symmetric with opening. Cold, clinical, machine-like. Continues thematic vocabulary.

## Why No HUD

The platter IS the interface. Coherence = glowing ring. Tension = sphere color + RGB drift + audio. All feedback through the machine itself.
