**Optimized Prompt for r21dev (ready to copy-paste)**

```prompt
Heavy industrial black metal 3D platter, lying perfectly flat on the ground, extremely thick and solid rim (at least 18cm deep visible from the player side), Babylon.js cinematic render style, high detail, dramatic shadowing, subtle surface wear and machined precision, cool blue pulsing RGB rim lighting embedded in the outer edge, emissive glow, realistic metal PBR material with slight oil sheen.

The platter rotates slowly and smoothly only around its invisible central vertical axis, completely fixed in position, no vertical movement allowed, feels extremely heavy and mechanical.

On the side facing the player, a precise horizontal slit emerges from the thick black rim. When activated, a satisfying mechanical garage-door effect occurs: the top half of the rim section slides upward and recedes smoothly into the platter depth, the bottom half slides downward and recedes into the platter depth, revealing visible internal mechanical depth and lighting.

From this revealed recess, a single customizable keyboard key smoothly emerges with realistic mechanical process — not instantaneous, but deliberate and satisfying (gears, slight resistance, precise alignment). The keycap is initially set to a glowing Play symbol (▶), with strong RGB lighting surrounding the key so the recess remains mostly hidden but emits a soft blue-to-cyan glow. The key itself has inset RGB lighting that pulses in sync with platter rim.

Separately, a lever component emerges from another section of the rim using the exact same garage-door split mechanism, but the recess for the lever remains visibly lit with RGB glow. Reference the lever-switch style from https://21st.dev/community/components/theutkarshmail/lever-switch/default and the bluetooth-key style from https://21st.dev/community/components/theutkarshmail/bluetooth-key/default, but adapted to heavy black metal industrial aesthetic with cool blue RGB accents.

In the exact center of the platter is a recessed circular track. Sitting inside this track is a large transparent glass sphere (diameter ~52cm), rendered as high-quality PBR glass with refraction, thin-film interference, and subtle thickness. Inside the glass sphere is a glowing celestial nebula shader effect (reference https://21st.dev/community/components/dhileepkumargm/celestial-sphere-shader/default), with calm blue tones at low tension that shift to yellows, greens, and finally violent reds as tension increases, with increasing static, jitter, and corruption inside the sphere.

Overall composition: dark industrial void background, dramatic rim lighting only, focus on the platter and sphere, cinematic Babylon.js render, ultra-realistic mechanical details, satisfying physical motion, no text, no HUD elements.

High detail, 8K, octane render quality, subtle dust particles on platter surface, perfect symmetry, mechanical precision.

### Why this prompt is optimized and aligned

- **Specific & Structured**: Starts with the platter core, then rotation constraint, then the exact garage-door mechanic, then key/lever details, then the sphere.
- **References Included**: Directly references your three components with "reference the ... style from [url]" so r21dev can pull visual style.
- **Modifications Specified**: "adapted to heavy black metal industrial aesthetic with cool blue RGB accents" — keeps the mechanical feel you want while matching our theme.
- **Tension-Ready**: The sphere description includes the color shift progression you want.
- **Mechanical Satisfaction**: Explicitly calls out "satisfying mechanical process — not instantaneous, but deliberate and satisfying (gears, slight resistance, precise alignment)" and "garage-door effect" with top-up/bottom-down motion.
- **No Vertical Movement**: Clearly states "completely fixed in position, no vertical movement allowed".
- **Flat Orientation**: "lying perfectly flat on the ground".
- **RGB Integration**: Cool blue pulsing rim lighting + inset RGB on keys/lever/recess.

### How to use it

1. Paste the entire prompt into r21dev.
2. Generate several variants.
3. Pick the best one and ask for refinements like "make the rim thicker", "more visible internal depth when slit opens", "stronger blue RGB pulse on rim", etc.

This prompt should give you much better, more consistent results than the previous ones because it is highly structured, references your exact components, and aligns perfectly with the platter + sphere + garage-door vision.

Once you have the generated 3D model, we can import it into Babylon.js/Reactylon as the base platter asset and animate the slit/garage-door/key emerge in code (we already have the animation logic ready from previous files).

Would you like me to:
- Generate the next code update that uses this new platter model?
- Refine the prompt further?
- Or move to the pattern stabilization + enemy integration with this new visual?

Just say the word and we keep building.  

The machine is ready to be built.
