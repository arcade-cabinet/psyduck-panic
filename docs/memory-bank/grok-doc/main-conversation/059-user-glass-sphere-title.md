We also don't need to humanize the EYE. We can take and adapt JUST the AI element from the code I posted and extrapolate it to a 3D sphere and like the code I shared already has, just a lens... In fact we could make the WHOLE sphere glass,, think the Sphere in las Vegas... In FACT whaT I just pasted with how it statics out and jars and bounces around??? If we built a glass sphere AROUND that effect and simply bent and distorted it to the glass it would be a very profound effect, at first strong, confident, calm blue tones, transitioning to yellows and greens and then finalyly to reds and things start to jump around and get crazy in there and eventually the glass shatters and that's game over
