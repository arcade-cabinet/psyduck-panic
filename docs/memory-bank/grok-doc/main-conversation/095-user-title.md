Right now it is TRULY endless which might ALSO make it boring over time is my concern. And we have a BAD ending, swhich probably should be COGNITION SHATTERED, but no GOOD ending, but ALSO like Candy Crush, etc... We don't NEED an ending unless the player LOSES, we just need to make it not REPETIVE
