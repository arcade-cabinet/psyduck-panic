**Prompt for r21dev:**

```
Heavy industrial black metal 3D platter, lying perfectly flat on the ground, extremely thick and solid rim (minimum 18cm visible depth from player side), Babylon.js cinematic render style, high detail, dramatic rim shadowing, subtle machined surface wear, cool blue pulsing RGB rim lighting embedded in the outer edge with emissive glow, realistic heavy metal PBR material with slight oil sheen and industrial precision.

The platter can ONLY rotate smoothly around its invisible central vertical axis. It is completely fixed in position — no vertical movement, no tilting, no floating. It must feel extremely heavy and solid.

On the side facing the player, a precise horizontal slit emerges from the thick black rim. When activated, a satisfying mechanical garage-door effect occurs: the top half of the rim section slides upward and smoothly recedes into the platter depth, the bottom half slides downward and smoothly recedes into the platter depth, revealing visible internal mechanical depth and subtle blue RGB lighting inside the recess.

From this revealed recess, a single customizable keyboard key smoothly emerges with realistic mechanical process — deliberate, satisfying, not instantaneous (gears, slight resistance, precise alignment). The keycap is initially set to a glowing Play symbol (▶), with strong RGB lighting surrounding the key so the recess remains mostly hidden but emits a soft blue-to-cyan glow. Reference the exact style and mechanical feel of this key: https://21st.dev/community/components/theutkarshmail/bluetooth-key/default — but adapted to heavy black metal industrial aesthetic with cool blue RGB accents.

Separately, a lever component emerges from another section of the rim using the exact same garage-door split mechanism. The recess for the lever remains visibly lit with RGB glow. Reference the exact style and mechanical feel of this lever: https://21st.dev/community/components/theutkarshmail/lever-switch/default — adapted to heavy black metal industrial aesthetic with cool blue RGB accents.

In the exact center of the platter is a recessed circular track. Sitting inside this track is a large transparent glass sphere (diameter ~52cm), rendered as high-quality PBR glass with refraction, thin-film interference, and visible thickness. Inside the glass sphere is the exact celestial nebula shader effect from this reference: https://21st.dev/community/components/dhileepkumargm/celestial-sphere-shader/default. The internal effect starts with calm confident blue tones, transitions through yellows and greens, and finally to violent reds as tension increases, with increasing static, jitter, bounce, and corruption inside the sphere.

Overall composition: dark industrial void background, dramatic rim lighting only, focus on the platter and sphere, cinematic Babylon.js render, ultra-realistic mechanical details, satisfying physical motion, no text, no HUD elements, high detail, 8K, octane render quality, subtle dust particles on platter surface, perfect symmetry, mechanical precision.

Generate multiple variants with different rim thicknesses, recess depths, and glass sphere transparency levels.

### Why this prompt is optimized for r21dev

- **Explicit URL references**: r21dev can directly pull visual and mechanical style from the three components you specified.
- **Clear mechanical constraints**: Fixed flat platter, only rotation on center axis, thick rim, visible internal depth.
- **Satisfying animation language**: "deliberate, satisfying, not instantaneous (gears, slight resistance, precise alignment)".
- **Glass sphere integration**: Directly references your celestial shader and specifies the color progression you want.
- **Tension-ready**: The sphere description includes the exact degradation path.
- **No ambiguity**: Everything is described in order of importance, with technical details (diameters, thicknesses, lighting).

### How to use it

1. Paste the entire prompt into r21dev.
2. Generate 4–6 variants.
3. Pick the best one and ask for refinements like:
   - "Make the rim thicker and more industrial"
   - "Increase visible internal depth when slit opens"
   - "Make the glass sphere more refractive"
   - "Stronger blue RGB pulse on rim"

Once you have the generated model, we can import it into Babylon.js/Reactylon and animate the slit/garage-door/key emerge using the code we already have.

Would you like me to prepare the Babylon.js import code for when you get the model, or refine this prompt further?

The platter is the last missing visual piece. Once we have it, the game is visually complete.  

Let me know how the generations turn out!
