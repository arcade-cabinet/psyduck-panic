I had r21dev make 5 variants for the following prompt: heavy black metal 3d platter rendered with shadowing and RGB rim lighting in a variety of cool blue tones, pulsing, with babylon js, Should feel SOLID,. Should be fixed such that you can't move it up and down, just rotate it along an invisible center point. Should be lying flat, NOT vertical. And be thick enough where (always the side facing TOWARDS the player) in response to events a slit can emerge corresponding to the size of the object within, and then "garage door up / down" effects slide a section OF the thick black rim of the platter such that after slitting open one part goes up and then receeds in, the other goes down and receeds in, exposing visible depth within. We want a single keyboard key to them slide out with a feeling of mechanical processe3s within, it should feel SATISFYING, not instantaneous. The key should have a customizable keycap that is initially set to a Play symbol, and have similar RGB lighting surrounding it such that the recess is not visible but emits an RGB glue. The same should also happen to emerge a lever, with an RGB glow that since for the lever, obviously the receess WOULD be visible, should light up the recess.
 
Sine that's the one piece we have no prior art for. It did.... Varyingly awful results.And also of course didn't include the sphere. what I therefore want you to do is make an OPTIMIZED aligned version of the prompt that will not only work better for our needs, but also include specific reference comoonents along with how we want to modify them, e.g. lever: https://21st.dev/community/components/theutkarshmail/lever-switch/default, key: https://21st.dev/community/components/theutkarshmail/bluetooth-key/default, sphere: https://21st.dev/community/components/dhileepkumargm/celestial-sphere-shader/default
