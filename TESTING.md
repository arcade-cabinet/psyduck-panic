# Psyduck Panic - Bug Fix & E2E Testing Implementation

## Summary

This PR successfully addresses the critical bug where the game immediately showed the retry screen upon starting, and implements comprehensive end-to-end testing infrastructure with Playwright.

## Bug Fix

### Issue
Clicking "START DEBATE" button caused the game to immediately display the retry/game over screen instead of starting gameplay.

### Root Cause
CSS specificity conflict:
- `#overlay` selector (ID) has `display: flex` 
- `.hidden` selector (class) has `display: none`
- ID selectors have higher specificity than class selectors
- Result: overlay remained visible even with `.hidden` class applied

### Solution
Added `!important` to the `.hidden` class:
```css
.hidden {
  display: none !important;
}
```

### Verification
- Tested with Playwright MCP browser
- Game now starts correctly and overlay properly hides
- Gameplay proceeds normally with all HUD elements visible

## E2E Testing Implementation

### 1. Comprehensive Playthrough Tests (`e2e/playthrough.spec.ts`)
Tests complete game flow including:
- Start screen to gameplay transition
- Keyboard controls (1, 2, 3, Q keys)
- Wave announcements and timing
- HUD elements (score, combo, panic meter, time)
- Screen state transitions
- Spacebar alternative start method

### 2. Game Governor (`e2e/helpers/game-governor.ts`)
Automated playthrough controller that simulates realistic player behavior:
- **Configurable Parameters:**
  - Aggressiveness (0-1): How often abilities are used
  - Reaction Time (ms): Delay between actions
  - Accuracy (0-1): Chance of correct decisions
  - Use Specials: Whether to use nuke ability

- **Features:**
  - Reads game state (panic level, score, time)
  - Makes intelligent decisions (uses nuke when panic > 50%)
  - Simulates human-like behavior with reaction times
  - Supports different play styles (aggressive, defensive, beginner)

### 3. Automated Governor Tests (`e2e/governor.spec.ts`)
Tests using the Game Governor for automated playthroughs:
- Default configuration playthrough
- Aggressive player simulation (high accuracy, fast reactions)
- Defensive player simulation (lower accuracy, slower reactions)
- Continuous gameplay verification

### 4. Screenshot Utilities (`e2e/helpers/screenshot-utils.ts`)
Utilities for proper canvas capture:
- `captureGameScreenshot()`: Enhanced screenshot capture
- `waitForGameReady()`: Ensures game is fully loaded
- `captureWithRetry()`: Retry logic for reliable captures
- Handles WebGL/Canvas rendering challenges in headless mode

### 5. Playwright Configuration Updates
Changed from failure-only to always-on capture:
```typescript
use: {
  trace: 'on',        // was: 'on-first-retry'
  screenshot: 'on',   // was: 'only-on-failure'
  video: 'on',        // was: 'retain-on-failure'
}
```

## Test Execution

### Running Tests
```bash
# All E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Specific test file
npx playwright test e2e/playthrough.spec.ts

# With UI mode
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

### Test Output Locations
- Screenshots: `test-results/screenshots/`
- Videos: `test-results/*/video.webm`
- Traces: `test-results/*/trace.zip`
- HTML Report: `playwright-report/`

## Code Quality

### Code Review
All issues from code review addressed:
- ✅ Fixed percentage string parsing (removed % before parseFloat)
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript type mismatches in timeout promises
- ✅ Added proper screenshot handling utilities
- ✅ Screenshots now always captured, not just on failure

### Security Scan
- ✅ CodeQL analysis: 0 vulnerabilities found
- ✅ No security issues in added code

## Known Limitations

### Canvas Rendering in Headless Mode
WebGL/Canvas content may render as blank/hourglass in headless browsers. Solutions implemented:
1. Screenshot utilities with retry logic
2. Direct canvas data extraction via `toDataURL()`
3. Always-on video recording for verification
4. Option to run tests in headed mode for visual verification

### Recommended for Visual Verification
```bash
# Run with headed browser to see actual rendering
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Or use UI mode with visual playback
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files
- `src/styles/game.css` - Added `!important` to `.hidden`
- `playwright.config.ts` - Changed to always capture screenshots/video/trace

### New Test Files
- `e2e/playthrough.spec.ts` - Manual playthrough tests
- `e2e/governor.spec.ts` - Automated governor tests
- `e2e/helpers/game-governor.ts` - Game Governor implementation
- `e2e/helpers/screenshot-utils.ts` - Canvas capture utilities
- `e2e/helpers/README.md` - Governor documentation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Manual Test
```typescript
test('game playthrough', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/psyduck-panic/');
  await page.locator('#start-btn').click();
  
  // Game should be playing
  await expect(page.locator('#overlay')).toHaveClass(/hidden/);
  await expect(page.locator('#wave-display')).toContainText('WAVE 1');
});
```

### Automated Governor Test
```typescript
import { GameGovernor } from './helpers/game-governor';

test('automated playthrough', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/psyduck-panic/');
  
  const governor = new GameGovernor(page, {
    aggressiveness: 0.8,
    accuracy: 0.85,
    reactionTime: 300,
  });
  
  const result = await governor.playthrough();
  console.log(`Result: ${result.result}, Score: ${result.score}`);
});
```

## Success Metrics

✅ **Bug Fixed**: Game starts correctly, no immediate game over
✅ **Test Coverage**: 17+ test scenarios covering core gameplay
✅ **Automation**: Game Governor enables AI-driven playthroughs
✅ **Visual Verification**: Always-on screenshots and video recording
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive README for Game Governor usage
✅ **Code Quality**: All code review issues addressed, no security vulnerabilities
✅ **CI Ready**: Tests configured for CI environments with retries

## Next Steps

1. **Run full test suite** in CI to verify all tests pass
2. **Review test recordings** to verify gameplay captures properly
3. **Add more advanced tests** for:
   - Boss battle mechanics
   - Power-up interactions
   - Multiple wave progression
   - Score persistence
4. **Consider adding visual regression testing** for UI consistency

## Conclusion

This PR successfully fixes the critical start screen bug and establishes a robust E2E testing framework that will help prevent similar issues in the future. The Game Governor provides a powerful tool for automated gameplay testing that can be extended for various testing scenarios.
